<p class="text-justify">This isn't a plugin in the normal context, more a tutorial on how to include Facebook Comments to the bottom of your Mediawiki articles. I also thought that some of you would find this a useful addition because the majority of commenting script are a little large, intrusive and resource intensive. Personally I don't think the Facebook comments plugin is that good looking,  but it certainly serves its purpose and it comes with the added bonus of promoting your wiki too. </p>
<p class="text-justify">To install you will need Facebook developer access and only a rudementary understanding of html.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Visit the Facebook Comments page and complete the form - <strong>[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments see here]</strong> and then click "get code".</p>
<p class="text-justify">If you already have a Facebook api key for your website, ignore the first section of Javascript, but copy and paste the second section (as below) into any article (or location) where you want to display comments. And that is it! See the results below and feel free to post any comments. </p>
